Learning Linux Journey

This will be my linux learning journey, starting off with basic sysadmin tasks and moving on further to more devops tasks with docker/ansible/k8s.

My focus in this first few days will be on bash scripting and user management.

I have created this repo and made this first commit through CLI.

By 28/09/2025, I am to have a script to create users, a script to create groups and a script to manage permissions.
