I had a little trouble with github since i'm using SSH built into CMD for this project rather than my old WSL instance.

I create a new SSH key with ssh-keygen and added it to my github profile.
I also had to include my new repo in my github PAT for it to authenticate correctly.

Not too much else to talk about since all I did was create the repo and structure.

Hopefully tomorrow we will have a working user creation script and the problems I faced getting it working in this documentation folder.
