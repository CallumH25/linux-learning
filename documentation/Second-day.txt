Today I learned about the basics of bash scripting, like the use of variables which is slightly different to the Powershell i'm used to.

The script I created today will ask you to give the name of the user you wish to create, create the user and their home directory with useradd $username -m.

After it creates the user, the script will ask you to create a temporary password for the user to login with, the user will then be forced to create their own password on logging in for the first time.

Learning how to do this with scripting is nice as i'm learning about different options on the commands, such as read -s making the typing for the prompt invisible to protect the password, and i've not used much linux before in the context of creating users, so I didn't know about passwd -e until doing this aswell.

I'm happy the script works, but in the future I will aim to add logging as soon as I figure out how to do that aswell.

The plan for tomorrow is to create a script that will create groups and also assign users to existing groups.
