So today I created the permissions script, it's pretty simple, I wasn't sure how else to script permissions.

Firstly, the script will ask for a group name you wish to give permissions to

Secondly, it will ask for the file path you want that group to have access to.

After that, it gives the group ownership to that folder and gives 775 permissions for it.

I had a bit of trouble with testing as I thought it didn't work at first but I needed to do "newgrp $grp" to refresh my groups and make sure the permissions worked properly.

I also added some basic logging to my scripts with a one liner at the top that I googled for, it needs some improving and I definitely need to learn how to log better as there aren't any timestamps for it yet, I will improve that tomorrow but atleast there is logging on the scripts now.
